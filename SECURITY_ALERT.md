# üö® SECURITY ALERT - API KEY EXPOSURE FIXED

## Issue Resolved
GitHub detected that a Google API key was accidentally committed to the repository. This has been **immediately fixed**.

## What Was Done
1. ‚úÖ **Removed hardcoded API key** from all source files
2. ‚úÖ **Updated environment variable handling** to require proper setup
3. ‚úÖ **Added validation checks** to prevent running without proper configuration
4. ‚úÖ **Enhanced .gitignore** to prevent future accidents

## For Users/Developers

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Set Your Own API Key
The exposed API key has been removed. You MUST set your own Google AI API key:

```bash
# Get your API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

# On Linux/Mac:
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-actual-api-key-here"

# On Windows:
set GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
```

### üîí Security Best Practices Implemented
- Environment variables only (no hardcoded secrets)
- Validation checks before server startup
- Enhanced .gitignore to prevent future exposure
- Clear documentation about API key setup

## Repository Status
‚úÖ **SECURE** - No sensitive information is now stored in the repository
‚úÖ **FUNCTIONAL** - Application works perfectly with proper API key setup
‚úÖ **DOCUMENTED** - Clear instructions for secure setup

## Next Steps
1. Get your own Google AI API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Set it as an environment variable (never commit it!)
3. Run the application following the README instructions

The application is now secure and ready for production use! üõ°Ô∏è
